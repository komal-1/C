Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data.

Memory --> (box/container)a --> 25
           (box/container)b --> 5

Example Code:
Hello.c

#include <stdio.h>  // preprocessor directive
int main() {
  int number = 25;
  char star = '*';
  int age = 22;
      age = 24; // we can update the value of variable.
  float pi = 3.14;
  return 0;
}


Rules for creating variables:
a. Variables are case sensitive.    // example int a =  30; and int A = 40; both are different.
b. 1st character is alphabet or '_'.  // int _age = 22; is valid variable name.
c. no comma / blank space.
d. No other symbol other than '_'.   // int final_price = 100;


Special Tip : Always keep meaningful variable name.
